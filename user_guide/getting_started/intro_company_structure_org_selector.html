<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Understanding the Company Structure</a><a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-the-company-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each enterprise is structured in a meaningful way. Big enterprises usually have several branches/offices, each of which
may be divided into several major divisions comprised of departments that may be comprised of several functional groups,
etc. Even small companies organize their workforce into teams.</p>
<p>For example, a telecommunication service provider might have several subsidiaries, e.g. in each of the states. The
Californian subsidiary may have two offices - Western and Eastern. In each of the offices there are unites working at
different directions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CaliforniaTelecom<ul>
<li>Western California<ul>
<li>Western California Stationary Phones</li>
<li>Western California Mobiles</li>
<li>Western California TV</li>
<li>Western California Internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eastern California<ul>
<li>Eastern California Stationary Phones</li>
<li>Eastern California Mobiles</li>
<li>Eastern California TV</li>
<li>Eastern California Internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each unit in its turn may be divided in teams, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eastern California Internet Office Employees</li>
<li>Eastern California Internet Field Workers</li>
<li>Eastern California Internet Freelance Employees</li>
</ul>
<p>The corporate structure is essential, as it defines the scope of the user’s tasks and and available resources. As a
business application, OroCommerce provides tools to reflect the corporate structure normally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-corporate-structure-is-reflected-in-orocommerce">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">How Corporate Structure is Reflected in OroCommerce</a><a class="headerlink" href="#how-corporate-structure-is-reflected-in-orocommerce" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="business-units">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Business Units</a><a class="headerlink" href="#business-units" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In OroCommerce, every business, division, or team of any kind may be represented by a business unit. The units can be
hierarchically organized in a tree-like structure that reflects the actual subordination of the organization.</p>
<p>So, for example, to represent the hierarchy of the above-mentioned telecom in California, we need to create two business
units that correspond to the two offices <em>&#8220;Western California&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Eastern California&#8221;</em>. Each of them will have child
business units that represent the directions: <em>&#8220;Stationary Phones&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;Mobiles&#8221;</em>, etc. Each of these child units, in its
turn, will be a parent unit to other business units that correspond to the teams.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eastern California business unit has a child business unit:<ul>
<li>Eastern California Stationary Phones that has child business units:<ul>
<li>Eastern California Stationary Phone Office Employees</li>
<li>Eastern California Stationary Phone Field Workers</li>
<li>Eastern California Stationary Phone Freelance Employees</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the system administrator usually creates such reflection of the organization’s hierarchy and defines what users
belong to them. <em>This affects the access and permissions granted to the users within the company</em>.</p>
<p>For example, users assigned directly to the  Eastern California business unit may see all the orders, requests and
sales reported by any of the users of the unit and its child unit. Thus an office manager will see all the accounts
created in any direction and by any kind of employee.</p>
<p>Users assigned to the child units may see only the accounts created within their unit - so, employees of the Stationary
Phone department will only see the items reported by members of their department, and won’t see items reported by
representatives of the Mobiles’ department.</p>
<p>In the same manner, the access may be limited for users assigned to the child-units of the next level, e.g. freelancer’s
may only see the information that has been reported or assigned to them directly, and office employees will see
information reported by any of their co-workers.</p>
<p>This will protect information on one hand, and help to protect users from being overwhelmed with non-relevant
information.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Access and permissions section for more details.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p class="last">By the user name, you can see the name of the business unit, that <em>&#8220;owns&#8221;</em> the user. This is also defined by the
system administrator and serves as additional information for other users.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>At least one business unit must be defined in the system.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="organizations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Organizations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#organizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the business unit hierarchy, OroCommerce Enterprise Edition provides the ability to create several
Organizations. Organizations may be described as large business units, independent enough in their operations to
require a high degree of separation and customization. Organizations provide a much higher degree of separation - every
organization in OroCommerce is basically a business in its own right. They might have their own hierarchies of business
units, use different languages and locales, or even the most common entities such as Contacts or Accounts may differ
from one organization to another. Data records that exists in one organization are normally not available to another.</p>
<p>Usually, organizations are need when their real-world counterparts have their own P&amp;L reports and balance sheets. For
the telecom in the example above, different organization could represent offices in each of the states. Another good
example for several organizations would be a franchisor that has several franchisees - the best way to represent each
of them in OroCommerce is a separate organization. Even a freelance entrepreneur working with several different businesses
from his computer will benefit using a separate organization to represent each of them in OroCommerce.</p>
<p>Subject to the work done in the company, some users may have access to several organizations
(work with multiple organization) or to all records across all organizations that are available to them
(work from a system organization). This is described below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-with-multiple-organizations">
<span id="user-guide-getting-started-change-organization"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Work with Multiple Organizations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#work-with-multiple-organizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In many cases a user has access to a single organization. A sales representative in the U.S. office is likely to have no
access to the company’s French division.</p>
<p>However, users can be assigned to multiple organizations just as they can be assigned to multiple business units and
will get access to the records in different organizations. For example, if you are working at the worldwide help desk
of a multinational organization, you should be able to access customer records in all the organization within your
company in order to open cases based on the customer requests. Similarly, if you are the CEO of a big enterprise
comprised of multiple independent divisions, you would like to have access to every one of them in order to check their
performance.</p>
<p>As organizations are often much bigger and more separated than business units, the user will have to switch to the
necessary organization to work with data in each one of them.</p>
<div class="section" id="switching-between-organizations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Switching Between Organizations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#switching-between-organizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The name of an organization you are currently working with is displayed in the top left corner of the screen. If you
have access to multiple organizations, upon your first login you will see a note with your current organization. Three
dots to the left are the organization selector.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/multi_org_select.png" src="../../_images/multi_org_select.png" />
<p>Click the selector, to see a list of organizations you have access to. Your current organization will be displayed in
bold. If a System organization exists, it will be shown at the top of the list and shifted left.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/multi_org_choice.png" src="../../_images/multi_org_choice.png" />
<p>To switch to another organization, click its name in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-with-a-system-organization">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Work with a System Organization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#work-with-a-system-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A System Organization provides users with simultaneous access to all the records of all the organizations they are
assigned to. There cannot be more than one system organization in OroCommerce.</p>
<p>When working in a system organization all grids will have an additional <em>&#8220;Organization&#8221;</em> column. The <em>&#8220;Organization&#8221;</em>
field will be shown for each record viewed. The organization field is not editable.</p>
<p>When creating a record in a system organization, the user should select an organization to which the record will belong.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/multi_org_system1.png" src="../../_images/multi_org_system1.png" />
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A record can belong to the system organization as well — if this is the case, the record won’t be accessible from
anywhere else other than the system organization itself. One example of such a record may be an aggregate report
based on data from multiple organizations — it will make sense only within the system organization where all the
necessary data is available.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Conclusion</a><a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Organizations and business units to which users belong will define the data available to them, and will mirror the
company structure and related rules from the physical world to the software application.</p>
