As many businesses provide services that do not have an upfront price, the costs can vary. That is where quotes come into the picture as they allow a prospective buyer to see the cost involved for an item or services. A quote in OroCommerce is used to negotiate with the customer (e.g. offer better price, more convenient quantities and additional services). It may be created in response to a customer request for quote, or as a result of the direct communication with the customer. Once the customer is happy with the offer in the quote and is ready to proceed with their order, they accept the quote.

To locate quotes:

1. Navigate to **Account** in the :ref:`user menu <frontstore-guide--navigation-user-menu>`.
2. Click **Quotes** in the menu on the left.
3. Alternatively, use the :ref:`Quick Access Menu <frontstore-guide--navigation-quick-access-menu>` and click **Quotes** in the top right corner of any page.
